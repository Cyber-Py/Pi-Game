# π!
Αυτό είναι ένα παιχνίδι στο οποίο πρέπει να πληκτρολογήσετε τα ψηφία του pi αφού σας δοθούν— Περιμένετε ένα λεπτό— WAIT A MINUTE, you don't know Greek! ~~I don't either lol~~

Ok so, back to the beginning.

This is a game in which you have to tpye in the digits of pi after you are given them. It will give a certain amount of time to read the π digits. Once it shows the `>` sign, only then type. Remember to only enter the digits you were given, or else the program will tell you you go t it wrong

That's it. I know this game is **SUPER** simple, but it is ~~kinda~~ fun.

BUT, if you think this is easy, you are in for a suprise:
You need to type in 52 digits of pi (including the beginning 3) 

If you do beat it, well, 
## THAT IS IMPRESSIVE

###### I'll give you a PIE, get it? lol



## Hope you enjoy!
